Core of the 2022 annual program of servus.at is AMRO, 
Art Meets Radical Openness, the biennial festival for art, 
hacktivism and open cultures, organized since 2008 by servus.at 
in cooperation with the Linz University of Art, Department of 
Time-Based Media.

After the 2020 edition, which was realized as an open source 
online event for well-known reasons, the 2022 goal is to plan 
the gathering again as an on-site event, enhanced by a system 
of hybrid interactions. As usual, the four days of the event 
will include: a discursive program with keynotes, panels and 
lectures; a hands-on track with workshops and showcases; a 
nightline with live coding, sound art and streaming.
