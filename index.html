			<h2>OPEN CALL – AMRO 15th–18th June 2022<br /></h2>
			<h2>

			<p class="to-mix">
				Core of the 2022 annual program of <a href="https://servus.at/">servus.at</a> is
				AMRO, Art Meets Radical Openness, the biennial festival for art, hacktivism and open
				cultures, organized since 2008 by servus.at in cooperation with the Linz University
				of Art, Department of Time-Based Media.<br /><br />
				After the 2020 edition, which was realized as an open source online event for
				well-known reasons, the 2022 goal is to plan the gathering again as an on-site
				event, enhanced by a system of hybrid interactions. As usual, the four days of the
				event will include: a discursive program with keynotes, panels and lectures; a
				hands-on track with workshops and showcases; a nightline with live coding, sound art
				and streaming.
			</p>
			<h2 class="to-mix">AMRO22: DEBUG</h2>
			<p class="to-mix">
				The current edition of Art Meets Radical Openness is dedicated to the rituals and
				the philosophies of debugging, which will be taken in AMRO22 as starting point for a
				conversation between artists, groups and communities moving together between the
				fields of culture, politics and technologies.
				<br /><br />
				Software bugs are much more than simple engineering mistakes. Under specific
				circumstances they can be seen as some of the fundamental features of the current
				era characterized by ubiquitous technologies. Bugs become visible when a program
				crashes or the browser window gets stuck; when the developers’ biases come to
				surface and where the limits of the current infrastructure are reached. Where
				technology fails, computers appear as what they are: funky, unstable conglomerates
				of functions, thrown together from different people in different times, at the point
				that they are barely working, needing constant care and fixes. In communities rooted
				in Free and Libre Open Source philosophy, developing and maintaining digital
				services becomes a practice of creating and sharing knowledge. Bugs locate on the
				area where what is familiar and can therefore be controlled meets what is not yet
				apprehended and therefore unstable.
				<br /><br />
				As a natural reaction to such malfunctionings, debugging is a set of more or less
				formalized practices to go through failure and try fixing it. Most of the times bugs
				are solved with a simple restart of the affected device, the classic turning it off
				and on again. Some other times, fixing it means opening the black box and checking
				its inner functions, and step by step excluding the working parts to isolate what
				needs to be fixed. It is not only about isolating the problem, but also recognizing
				what works well and finding a new workable equilibrium with it, maybe with a smart
				hack or with some freshly gathered knowledge coming from someone from a community.
				AMRO as a gathering of communities with interests across arts and cultures,
				networked technologies and political action offers space for sharing knowledge and
				practices, focusing on the potential of debugging also outside the purely
				technological realm. How can we challenge the ways of addressing climate change or
				social inequalities through the lenses of open source cultures and radical,
				autonomous technologies? And in the case that given enough eyeballs, all bugs are
				shallow, how can we strengthen the connection and exchange between individuals and
				communities aiming at radical openness?
			</p>

			<h2 class="to-mix">Call for participation</h2>
			<p class="to-mix">
				The program of AMRO is enriched by a call of participation open to artists,
				programmers, researchers, activists and free spirits. You are welcome to propose a
				program point through our form, we will get in touch with you over the next weeks.
				<br /><br />
				The proposal for participation will be reviewed by a group of long-term AMRO
				community members, that will evaluate the thematic affinity of the proposal with
				AMRO22 topic DEBUG and with our Festival Policies (see below).
				<br /><br />
				Please consider that our resources are limited. In case your work is not selected
				for AMRO22, we might still want to contact you for future projects. Your data will
				not be shared with third parties.
			</p>
			<h2 class="to-mix">Formats:</h2>
			<h3 class="to-mix">* Lectures or Panel proposals (up to 40 minutes)</h3>
			<h3 class="to-mix">
				* Workshops, Artwork presentations & Showcases, Performances (ca 30 min).
			</h3>
			<p class="to-mix">
				Since its beginnings, AMRO is a place for exchanging ideas and sharing discussions
				about ongoing processes. Within the framework of the showcase we are able to provide
				a possibility to display your work within the festival locations or outdoors. You
				can propose projects that are still in development or that need some external point
				of view. Installations / objects / interventions … should be accompanied by a
				presentation and/or a skill-sharing workshop.
			</p>
			<h3 class="to-mix">* Performances, Nightline</h3>
			<p class="to-mix">
				If a 3D-rendered tree falls into a virtual forest, and there is nothing that listens
				to it, will it produce sound? What is the squeak of the fauna living at the borders
				of the corporate web? Do bots cry when one is rude to them? We are “simply” looking
				for the sonic-apparatus that can hack data-capitalism. Got some?
				<br /><br />
				We are open to any experimental approach towards machines and sound. Your presence
				at the festival should also include an active skill-sharing part with the other
				participants (workshop or presentation).
